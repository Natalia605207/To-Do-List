## Description

To manage your time as well as to plan your day you cannot do without a to-do-list app.
It is very ease to use and is of a great help. You can add as many things to do as you need. 
As soon as your task is finished you can click and cross it out.
Delete all tasks for today with a "Delet All" button.

The application also shows **today's date** for convenience.

***The purpose of this project*** was to train my skills in building React apps, particularly to work with Class Components.
